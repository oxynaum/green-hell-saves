GreenHell Save files manipulator

As you know. in Green Hell game there are only 4 saving slots. That is really strange and hard for people that like exporations and not long storyes and fights. 
So there is a littl helper for this :-)

Tested on Win 10 only!
It's batch command files that you should put in the folder where are save files stored. in my comp it's this path:
   D:\Steam\userdata\120327869\815370\remote

Than you just need to run it by double-click. And you'll see "menu" with 3 options:
1. Just Backup - it just takes all save files and copy them to "bkp" folder. If there were already files in this folder, it moves them to "bkp/<timestamp>. In this case you can track all your changes and return to any stage than.
2. Backup to "Mode-Level" folder - this option is for more variative players when you play Story, and Survive, and Coop and all of them in different difficulty levels :-). In this option you'll be asked to name the Mode, than name the Level. Than it creates folder like this: Story-Welcome. But you can name it as you want - it's just a name that should say you something. BTW - same procedure with backing up previous files in timestamp folder.
3. Restore - it's restore files from "Mode-Level" folder with prompt to override. 

General notes:
1. BE CAREFULL! It's just a file manirulation script, it doesn't know your intentions or expectations.
2. Because of 1st above - I suggest to start any procedure with #1 - Just Backup. It just saves current files aside and you can restore them physically and manually anytime later if something went wrong.
3. This script I wrote for me and it's good for me. It wasn't made to be universal or "fool-proof" or cross-platform. If you want change it - do it! :-) If it will be something good for someone else - share it.
  

Happy gaming for all of you!
Oxymoron :-)
